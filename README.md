# 👋 Hi there, I'm Abdelkader

🚀 A focused and unconventional developer passionate about **AI, mathematics, and building systems from first principles**.  
🧠 I enjoy going deep — understanding how things *really* work, not just how to use them.

I like working on ambitious projects, especially those involving **machine learning, language models, and experimental ideas** that push my limits.

## 🧩 About Me

- 🎯 Goal-driven, disciplined, and long-term focused  
- 🧠 I enjoy complex problems and non-standard thinking  
- 🤖 Strong interest in **Artificial Intelligence & LLMs**  
- 🔢 I like mixing **math + code + logic**  
- 🎮 Anime fan (especially magic systems, strategy, and power scaling)  

I don’t chase hype.  
I build foundations.

## 🚧 Current Project

### 🧠 MiniGPT

**MiniGPT** is a tool designed to **create useful LLMs for medium-scale and research-oriented projects**.

🔹 Focuses on:
- Training and experimenting with **custom LLM architectures**
- Practical usability for **research and real projects**
- Efficiency, clarity, and learning-by-building

This project represents my philosophy:  
**understand → build → optimize**.

> More details coming as the project evolves.
